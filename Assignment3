Q1. Create a basic online calculator. Using a web form, the user specifies an operation (such as “+” or
square root) and its arguments. The server then computes and returns the result. Use a servlet for the
web tier and EJB(s) for the actual mathematical operations. Support the
four basic arithmetical operations (+,-,*,/) and two unary operations (e.g., square root or sine).
Hint: Starting from certain example code from the lectures, this should be quite easy...

Q2. Extend your project created for the previous question with a security feature (implemented using
security means presented in the lectures): only authenticated users with role “CalculatorUser” should
be able to use your servlet. Create at least two example users to test your implementation. Also
submit any created or modified configuration and property files. No need to encrypt interactions.
