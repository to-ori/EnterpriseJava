Q1. Modify/extend the given client program (ClientSimple.java) so that it provides a Swing-based
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for letting the user interact with the server.
There should be a window which contains an input text field for the amount which should be converted and
two buttons, labelled “lb->kg” (i.e., pounds to kg) and “lb->kg”. After the user has clicked on one of these
buttons, the conversion result (returned from the server) should be displayed in the same window
(somewhere below or next to the input field and buttons, not in a popup window). The user can afterwards
perform a new conversion using your GUI or close the window (ends the client program).

Q2. Suppose you want to analyze the data produced by a couple of weather stations (meteorological stations).
Create a Java class WeatherStation with the following attributes (fields): the city where the station is
located and the station’s measurements (an ArrayList of objects of class Measurement). Also create a class
Measurement. Objects of class Measurement should have attributes time (an integer, representing the time
of the measurement) and temperature (a double number).
Add a method averageTemperature(startTime, endTime) to class WeatherStation which returns the
average temperature measured by the weather station between startTime and endTime.
You need to implement this method using a Java 8 Streams (to operate on sequences of measurements within
your method) and Lambda Expressions, as far as possible.
Also, add a main-method where you call your method using some test data and print the result.
